Eisenhower Task Manager is a personal organizer based on the Eisenhower Matrix. The principle is to prioritize tasks by urgency and importance results in 4 quadrants with different work strategies. For the story:
> Dwight D. Eisenhower was the 34th President of the United States from 1953 until 1961. Before becoming President, he served as a general in the United States Army and as the Allied Forces Supreme Commander during World War II. He also later became NATOâ€™s first supreme commander. Dwight had to make tough decisions continuously about which of the many tasks he should focus on each day. This finally led him to invent the world-famous Eisenhower principle, which today helps us prioritize by urgency and importance.
